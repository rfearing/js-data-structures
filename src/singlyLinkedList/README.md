# Singly Linked List

From [geeksongeeks.com][geeks]:

> [A singly linked list] is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. The node contains a pointer to the next node means that the node stores the address of the next node in the sequence. A single linked list allows traversal of data only in one way
