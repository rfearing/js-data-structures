# Basic Data Structures in JavaScript

### The purposes of this repository:
- Solidify my understanding of Data Structures
- Get me acquainted with GitHub Packages
- Create an npm package, where I can use my own implementations of these data structures, should I choose to.

### It does not attempt to:
- Replace [datastructures.js][datastructures-js]
- Teach data structures, per se, but could be used as examples to help you learn

If you are looking for a location to learn data structures in JavaScript, [this repository][js-algo] is probably what you're looking for.


Each Data Structure will have it's own README describing the data structure. Hopefully, this list will continue to grow.

**Data Structures:**
- [ ] Singly Linked List
- [ ] Double Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Binary Heap
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Graph
